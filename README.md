## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Angular CLI 20.2.0 or higher

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 💻 Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🏗️ Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## 📦 Building

To build the project for production:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:

```bash
ng test
```

## 🔍 Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
